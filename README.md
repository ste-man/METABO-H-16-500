METABO H 16-500 is an excellent hot air gun with 2 speed/heat options ("reduced" vs "full") and was available for a decent price.
I purchased the device and later realized that I want an option to turn off the heat, but keep the fan running for cooling.

My direct idea was to simply install an additional on/off-switch and disable the heating element, but it turns out that the fan is in series with the heating element so much more effort is required in order to control the fan individually.

I made an electrical schematic in order to help anyone else having similar ideas. See electrical schematic uploaded.
